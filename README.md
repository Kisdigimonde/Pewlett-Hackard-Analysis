# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Bobby and I have acquired two assignments, for the staff's "silver tsunami". The first, to use SQL to determine the amount of employees ready for retirement per title. And, to use SQL to find the employees who are eligible to join in a mentorship program. This was achieved by making sure that employees were not in the database multiple times, sorting employees by certain birth dates, and filter former employees from the query.

## Results
### Retiring Employees
- 133,777 employees who are born between 1952 and 1955 are set to retire. There are a total of 300,025 employees, which makes the retirement rate around 44%.

### Retiring Titles
- Senior Engineer is the title 29,415 that have the most amount of employees retiring, with Senior Staff not far behind with 28,255, and the lowest being managers with 2 retiring.

### Unique Titles
- Most retiring employees have a "Senior" title, which could suggest that they have been at the company for an extended amout of time.

### Mentorship Eligibility
- 1550 employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. And again, many employees that have a "Senior" title are eligible.

## Summary
### "Silver Tsunami"
Many employees are leaving the company, which means that many new employees will be joining the force. This will account for perhaps 130,000+ jobs that need to be filled. Though, keep in mind, many of the roles that will be left behind are "Senior" titles; this means that there may be a high amount of internal promotions rather than acquiring new yet experiences "Senior" employees. The "Silver Tsunami" is taking out a leap of high status employees that will need to be filled, hopefully the transition is gradual.

### Mentoring the next generation
There are many "Senior" status employees, and 2 a couple "Manager" status employees, totaling 57,672. This large group of employees will be able to efficiently train and mentor the new generation of Pewlett Hackard employees due to their experience, knowledge, skill, and time.
